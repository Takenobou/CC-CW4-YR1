                    I have been able to develop my management skills further with this module, with deadlines to hit, it has allowed me to work consistently and in a timely manner. 
                    Earlier this year, in A-Levels, I had to produce my own project for Computer Science. 
                    I used my time effectively, starting with interviewing consumers for insight into the field, asking questions relating to current solutions. 
                    I used this research to provide a better solution, designing my program to meet their needs effectively and managing my time throughout to make sure that when I finished my project, I would have time to do final interviews with consumers, asking their opinions and making final tweaks.
                    This allowed me to produce a final product that met the needs of the consumers well, with very positive feedback and implementing the final suggestions before submission. This allowed me to achieve highly in my final grade for the subject, attaining an A overall. 
                    On reflection, the skills I developed throughout this project has helped me tremendously with this module with the ability to work through assignments well as it gave me confidence to trust my management skills.

                <div class = "left-accent"><h2>Teamwork</h2></div>
                <p>
                    With the amount of group work in this module, I have had the opportunity to develop my teamwork skills greatly as before, I would not have considered this to be a strength of mine.
                    Last year, I worked in a group to develop a model rocket for the ukROC challenge.
                    I worked in a group of 5, with my role of designing and developing the flight computer in the rocket to keep it stable during ascent, and staging correctly when it got to the altitude.
                    We worked consistently, meeting regularly and we produced a working test rocket.
                    The result of the first flight was amazing, with no major issues.
                    Sadly the competition was canceled due to COVID but it was a great team building opportunity.
                    This project gave me confidence when working in a group and I have been able to develop it further this term.

                <div class = "left-accent"><h2>Implementing learning</h2></div>
                <p>
                    Implementing learning has been a great improvement this term as this termâ€™s schedule really helped me improve my learning cycle with the regular courseworks. 
                    Whilst learning bash, along with the lectures, tutorials and labs I was able to implement my skills into coursework 3, able to complete all tasks in the group well, completing all requirements. 
                    I was able to incorporate knowledge I got from lectures and ones I picked up from labs to ameliorate my code. 
                    As a group, we submitted the code fully working and complete. 
                    On reflection the skill of implementing learning for me has been greatly improved as I was able to practise it consistently throughout the term.

                <div class = "left-accent"><h2>Critical thinking</h2></div>
                <p>
                    I believe critical thinking is one of my greater strengths, although this term has really helped me improve this skill through learning new approaches to problem solving. 
                    This term has helped me improve my critical thinking through opening me up to understanding the links between ideas, allowing me to experiment with solutions in labs. 
                    Courseworks has shown me the importance and relevance of alternate arguments and ideas, improving the way I approach tasks as now I place more importance on planning and considering multiple approaches to a task before implementing them. 
                    Developing my critical thinking skills this term has allowed me to tackle problems and errors in a constructive, consistent and systematic way through programming tasks and lab exercises. 
                    I have also taken up reflection as part of my work process reflecting on my reasonings for my solutions and scrutinising them. 
                    This skill has allowed me to become more critical about the way I think, training me to consistently consider other solutions to problems that I would never have thought of before, I believe this will allow me to able to adapt to many situations and tasks, although it is an always improving skill.
